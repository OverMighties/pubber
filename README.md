## About
### What is the idea's origin?
The idea behind Pubber is quite simple. My friend and I wanted to create a app that allows both you and us to quickly and easily choose a pub. Personally, I enjoy pub crawling once in while, but I always struggle to decide which pub to visit based on Google Maps. This inspired us to develop Pubber, and now here we are!
### Who are we?
The entire codebase, from A to Z, has been developed by two studentsâ€”one from PW and another from AGH.
### What are the future plans for the app's development?
We will keep this section regularly updated, so make sure to check it out once in a while!\
